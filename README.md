## Mission Statement
Having a software to organize your daily routine, your work calendar, or just your life and thoughts shouldn't be this hard, or expensive. The idea of this planner was to be helpful for those that would need something simple, and that could be stored somewhere safe. No information is more private than in our own heads, but sometimes this is not possible for some. Saving it in one machine only then, without it going through networks and stored in locations we don't know the safety they have, was the closest second best option.

## Code of Conduct
Don't be evil.
- If ever this project needs an online server, it's highly recommended to use proper encryption, safety over performance.
- If this project ever needs money, it's highly recommended to ask for money instead of monetizing it with bad practices (ads, blocking parts of the software and locking people out of it)
- Minimalism is essential since the project was idealized for Students with Autism
- If a feature is so complex that the minimalism/simplicity of use is gone for the users, this feature is bad for this project
